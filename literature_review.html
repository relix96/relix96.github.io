    <h1 class="center"> Mitigating personal information exposure on the web</h1>

    The personal information exposure on the web it is a concern for everyone nowadays because we living in 21 century, better known as the “Digital Age”. Nowadays the people need to be careful when the data is exposed to an identity because we do not know what is the purpose of that data. With wifi in coffee shops, airports, shopping centre people need to be careful what information they put because that network do not have any security and any hacker can get access to that information( personal details, bank account details), beware about with the smartphone apps permissions to allow to get access to location, contacts, camera. With this permissions people and companies can get access to the smartphone and can see the personal data on the smartphone.

Dangers that may exist

With all the technologies available, nowadays a hacker knows how to hack a network and the record what people search in the web.
Nowadays, it is very dangerous to give personal data online to entities (banks, companies, supermarket) because there may be a lack of security and someone stealing personal data of people. When a person registers their personal data online, that data is recorded in a database in which several companies have access to that database. With this access, a company can send emails, text messages without customers not having registered on various company websites.
For example, in May 2018 Facebook social network creator Mark Zuckerberg, [3(Kaleigh Rogers, Apr 11 2018)]attended a hearing in the European Parliament because of the controversy over the sale of personal data from customers without their knowledge of a company contracted by Facebook to collect customer data.
One of most unsafe places to store the personal data are the online cloud. [1(Techopedia, N/D)]A cloud storage it is a computing model which data is stored on a server and can only be accessed through the internet. [2(By Sean Bradley, 17 Apr 2018 )]The online cloud it is very good to store data but it is not safe, because between data client data and the cloud there is a key for all clients to get access to their data. If the online cloud is compromised someone else can discover that key and get access to the data belonging to that account.

How to prevent that?

    There is many ways to prevent to exposed personal data on the web for example: [4(Mindaugas Caplinskas,  24 February 2015)]using a VPN, using smart password security rules, show less personal information on social media, using an anti-malware software, using websites secured and be careful with the scammers.
    [5(SaferVPN / N/D)]When we are connected to the network we should use a VPN (Virtual Private Network). VPN is a secure connection encrypted to prevent the data being stolen by a hacker. Using a VPN is the best way to surf on the web without any concerns (people on the same network can get access to other devices without an encrypted connection).
Having the habit to use some rules for passwords it is very clever because depending on how many characters password has is more difficult to decode. Therefore it is not advisable to use the same password for everything because if someone discovers, is easier to get access to all accounts that people have.
When people access a website, the website must have a certificate to show if it is safe to access on the website or not. If the website does not have a certificate it is not secure to access. Most of the sites are made by hackers to invade and steal personal information while people do not know what is going on behind their screen.
    There are thieves everywhere. In the digital world, they are known by the name scammers. A scammer is a person to steal money, personal data by getting in touch with people on the web to get what they want. They can send an email, a message on social media to share a video or saying ”Click here to win 1.000.000£”. But what people do not know what is going on behind their screen, they can get access to the entire network steal your personal information, bank account details on the device and get access to your bank account, hack the social media account (Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp) and get all the information of the victim. In the year of 2018, a virus was being sent in the form of a video, when a victim opens a link sent by a friend, the virus spread to all friends list and send the same message to them.
With many threats in the network, it is necessary to have a good anti-malware installed on the devices. No matter what precautions are taken an anti-malware it is necessary. There is some virus that antivirus detects and that the websites do not. [6(Wkipedia, N/D)]A firewall is a group of security rules which manage the network security. There are many firewalls in a company to be sure the data is safe, some websites cannot be accessed because of the firewall block due to the threats that can enter the network and compromise the entire network.
To reduce the risk exposure personal information on the web is advised to follow the previous examples due to the examples are given “Dangers that may exist” the best way to save the personal data is do not share with anybody the credentials to access on a bank account, social media account. Of course, there are many ways to avoid exposing personal data.
